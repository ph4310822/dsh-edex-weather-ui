# dsh-edex-ui

**DeepSeek Harness eDEX-UI shell plugin** — a terminal-inspired by https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui overlay for the
DSH web GUI. Adds a classic eDEX-UI layout: system telemetry left bar, world-map
right bar, filesystem browser, and a terminal-styled composer input — all wrapped
around the original UI.

## Features

- **Left bar** — system overview panel: CPU, memory, swap, processes, platform
  info, and thermal/power state, with per-core CPU sparklines
- **Right bar** — network status + encom-globe world view with endpoint markers
  and spline links, plus a dual up/down traffic chart with grid
- **Top panel** — an empty full-width strip overlaying the shell's top edge
  above every layer (ready for future chrome)
- **Bottom panel** — one strip hosting three swappable widgets, each wrapped in
  the same title/border chrome:
  - **DIR** — filesystem browser as a terminal-style LIST (icon + name +
    DIR/FILE), the same width as the left bar, with storage bar
  - **PREVIEW** — file preview / editor pane (text, code, images), spanning
    the center region
  - **TERMINAL** — a real host shell: commands execute through the
    `systemMetrics.runCommand` Remote (`sh -c`, 30s timeout), with client-side
    `cd`/`clear`/`help`/`pwd`, ↑/↓ history, and a prompt that follows the
    filesystem browser until you run your first command
- **Terminal-styled composer** — flattened input capsule, green block caret, and
  a `~/<workspace>` path prompt at the left edge of the input area
- **Workspace-follow** — the dir panel and prompt track the active conversation's
  workspace; switching sessions navigates both the filesystem browser and the
  prompt
- **Green-on-black skin** — token overrides recolour the entire original UI to
  terminal green, without touching the user's theme preference

## Installation

The plugin is published to npm as `@danielng23/dsh-edex-ui`. From the harness
checkout:

```sh
pnpm dsh plugin --profile web add @danielng23/dsh-edex-ui
pnpm dsh web   # serves the eDEX shell over the default GUI
```

To run the local checkout instead of the npm release (for development), add
the bundle with a `file:` path — its `file:` dependency specs link the local
sub-packages:

```sh
pnpm dsh plugin --profile web add file:/path/to/dsh-edex-ui/packages/bundle
```

See [LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md](LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md) for the three-instance port
layout (3080 baseline / 3081 npm / 3083 local), the build, and the iteration
workflow.

## Development

See [LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md](LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md) for the full build, install,
and iteration workflow. The widget architecture for the shell bars is
documented in [WIDGETS.md](WIDGETS.md).
